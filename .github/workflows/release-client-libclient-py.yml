name: Push libclient-py Package for Pypi

# NOTE:
# The version of the python library is automatically generated by setuptools_scm from the git tag and the distance of the commit hash.
# When uploading to pypi, the version of the tag is `[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+.` If a tag is not in this format, or if an action other than a tag is triggered, pypi will generate a version format error.
# Therefore, the client module must be in the format `[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+.`
